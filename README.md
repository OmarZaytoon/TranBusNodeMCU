Tranbus Itâ€™s an Android application that helps people to find the nearest public transportation buses to them and that make it easier for them to move from one place to another using these buses. The NodeMCU (ESP8266) piece is locating inside theses buses. Then it sends live location to the server. Through Tranbus, people can send their places to the server, and here lies the role of the server in determining and sending the location of the nearest bus to the person.
